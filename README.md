Project Domain: Retail Analytics

This repository contains a simple analysis of mall customer data using k-means clustering. The goal is to segment customers based on their spending patterns and demographic information to better understand their behavior and identify potential marketing strategies.

## Overview

In this project, we use k-means clustering to segment customers based on different feature combinations:
- Age vs. Spending Score
- Age vs. Annual Income
- Annual Income vs. Spending Score

The k-means clustering analysis provides insights into customer segmentation based on different feature combinations. The resulting clusters can be used to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the Mall Customer Segmentation Data, which includes the following attributes:
- `CustomerID`: Unique ID assigned to each customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousand dollars
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature
